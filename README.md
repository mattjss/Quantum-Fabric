# Quantum Fabric

An interactive particle system that creates a mesh-like fabric of interconnected points. The particles respond to mouse movement and create an ethereal, quantum-like visualization.

## Features
- Interactive particle system with mouse tracking
- Beautiful blue-white gradient effects
- Mesh-like connections between particles
- Click-triggered explosion effect
- Smooth particle physics and animations

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Start a local server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`)
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Interactions
- Move your mouse to attract particles
- Click anywhere to trigger an explosion effect
